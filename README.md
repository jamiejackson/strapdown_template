#Description 
------------
I use Strapdown to make the documentation of personal projects    
After some time, I made a few changes to the Strapdown, and built a template. from where to start any new document.    
And here it is, the current version of it [strapdown_template.md.html](https://github.com/zipizap/strapdown_template/raw/master/strapdown_template.md.html)     
Simply download it and fill-it-in with your documenting-info using markdown syntax.  
Then save and open it in a browser, and you will see it all colorfull and cheery :)  


#Can be improved
------------
  + It needs internet connection to download the javascript libs that it uses (would be nice to have an offline-stand-alone version)
  + I don't like that html-bottom of the template: its big, chunky and ugly. Maybe some day I'll have the time to make it tiny tiny like a couple lines.


#Many thanks to:
-----------
  + [Strapdown.js](http://strapdownjs.com/)
  + [Jquery TOC plugin](http://projects.jga.me/toc/#toc0)
  + JQuery, Bootstrap and all other infamously renowned projects who made this possible
  + all the open source community and happy people :)  (not joking!)
